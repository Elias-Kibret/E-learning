                                Dubai: What a difference a few days can make. England thrashed Iran 6-2 in their opening match of the FIFA World 
                                Cup Qatar 2022 and confidence in Gareth Southgate’s team was at an all-time high

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But they then followed that scintillating display with a dire show against 
                                the USA in which they were fortunate to get a point.

                                Even though Southgate kept faith with the same 11 that did so well against
                                 Iran, it was like watching a totally different team.
                                 In fact the only thing recognizable about England from their first match was the kit that they were wearing.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Against Iran, England were on the front foot. They passed and moved the ball around at speed and with confidence. They looked threatening every time they ventured forward. 
                                They pressed the Iranian back five and forced them into making mistakes.
                            </p>
                         
                            <p>
                                But that hunger and desire and passion that saw them overwhelm 
                                Iran was nowhere to be seen against the USA. Instead, what we got was a lacklustre effort and 
                                when the full time whistle blew it drew loud jeers from the English fans.
